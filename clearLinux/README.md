# ClearLinux scripts

Useful scripts and commands for ClearLinux OS - https://clearlinux.org
Some of the scripts are taken from Internet. Some of them are modified by me

ClearLinux uses its own package manager called swupd. Since it is fairly new a lot of the packages like opera,chrome,terminator etc. are not available. 

"opera.sh" will download and instll latest opera build and it will enable H.264 codecs.
